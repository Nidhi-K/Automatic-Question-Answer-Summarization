# Automatic_Question_Answer_Summarization
In this work, we present an automatic question-answering system for online question-answering websites like Quora, Stack Overflow and Yahoo. A lot of information on these sites tends to be repeated, as different users ask duplicate questions. Our goal is to answer a new question by summarizing the answers to the previously-asked similar questions. Details of implementation are in `Report.pdf`.

To run: `python3 main.py` (uses Pytorch 1.0)
