# Automatic_Question_Answer_Summarization
In this work, we present an automatic question-answering system for online question-answering websites like Quora, Stack Overflow and Yahoo. A lot of information on these sites tend to be repeated, as different users ask duplicate questions. Our goal is to answer a new question by summarizing the answers to the previously-asked similar questions. For fetching similar questions from the database, we implemented a Siamese-Recurrent Architecture which is trained to identify semantically similar question pairs. We extended the idea for question recognition by implementing a classifier. It helped us to achieve a best accuracy of 80% on the development dataset. For the task of answer summarization, we explored attention-based encoder-decoder model with coverage mechanism. We also present a novel question-centric summarization where question embeddings are taken as input to the decoder to provide contextual support.A system, which, given a question, detects all the other duplicate questions that have been asked before, and returns a summary of their answers.

To run: `python3 main.py`
